	I hope nothing happened to the others..

>"Seven" RIGHT "laughing" RIGHT
	Haha! Don't worry about them, they'll sure be fine!

>"Snake" LEFT "smiling" LEFT
	I'm pretty confident they're safe too.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	Well, let's get out of here and confirm this with our own eyes.

>"Snake" LEFT "shocked" LEFT
	Wait, what about that safe we didn't open ?

>"Seven" RIGHT "shocked" RIGHT
	I almost forgot it! We didn't need to open that safe to escape this room.

#SET_BACKGROUND "First class cabin"::"safe room"

>"Snake" LEFT "thinking" LEFT
	Why would Zero put this safe in front of us without giving us any way of opening it?

>"Junpei" LEFT
	If Zero didn't want us to get what's in this safe, he could've just not put it there.

>"Seven" RIGHT "thinking" RIGHT
	Then we should've missed something in this room that will permit us to open this safe.

>"Snake" LEFT
	Or maybe we'll found the way to open that safe later.

	Junpei wanted to..
	-Search this room again.

	-Get out of here to meet the others.

	Seven left Junpei alone with Snake, who still seemed to be thoughtful about the safe thing.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	Which place do you want to search?

	Snake didn't answered, maybe he didn't heard Junpei at all.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	I'll check the bathroom then.

	Junpei left Snake alone in his thoughts.

		When he entered the hallway, he found Seven, looking at him.

	>"Seven" RIGHT "idle" CENTER
		Hey Junpei, won't you mind helping me a little ?

	>
		Junpei found his request weird.
		Why would Seven need his help to check a room they already explored ?
		The more he thought about it, the more he found Seven's behaviour strange.
		He decided to...
		-Go help Seven
			->accept seven's proposition
		-Search the bathroom
			->deny seven's proposition

	Junpei joined Seven in the living room.
	Seven seemed pleased about it.

#SET_BACKGROUND "First class cabin"::"living room"

>"Seven" RIGHT "idle" CENTER
	Sorry if I looked suspicious, but I didn't want Snake to know about us talking privately.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	Snake ?

>"Seven" RIGHT
	He may be blind, but he has sharp ears, he could have heard us in the hallway.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	I guess, but why don't you want him to hear us ?

>"Seven" RIGHT "thinking" CENTER
	I want to share you something, something which might be important for later.
	But I don't trust him, for the moment, so I'll only share it with you.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	Thanks, but why do I have your trust ?

>"Seven" RIGHT "idle" CENTER
	When you chose to get into door 5 in order to spare Clover to have to look at the ninth man corpse, you appeared to me like a good boy.
	In our situation, people on whom you can count are precious, and you seem to be trustworthy, so I'll trust you.

>
	Junpei indeed felt relieved to consider this mountain as a potential ally.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	Well then, what do you want to share with me ?

>"Seven" RIGHT
	I want to share you all my love.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	WHAT??

>"Seven" RIGHT "laughing" CENTER
	Ah ah ah, I'm joking I'm joking.
	#SET_CHARACTER CENTER "Seven"::"idle"
	Come with me.

	Seven headed back to the entrance hallway.
	Junpei felt anxious when he remembered that's where still lied the ninth man corpse.
	He joined Seven anyway.

	Junpei stood still facing the flesh and blood pile that was several minutes ago a human being.
	However, Seven didn't seem worried.

>"Seven" RIGHT
	The ninth man bracelet, I'll pick it.
	That's what I wanted to share with you.

>
	Junpei suddendly realized how important this bracelet was.
	Adding 9 to any number won't change its digital root.
	Seven could go through any numbered door with one person less than he needed.

>"Seven" RIGHT
	If I'm telling this to you, it's not for you to spread it to whoever comes to you.
	But if at one moment you'll need this bracelet, I'll let you borrow it.

>
	Junpei was happy to hear Seven's sayings.

>"Junpei" LEFT
	I'll ask you in case.
	Thank you Seven.
	
>"Seven" RIGHT
	Let's get back into the living room, I don't want Snake to find us here.

	On these words, Seven went back to the living room, followed by Junpei.

	After several minutes of intense searching, Junpei and Seven met again in the hallway.

	So Junpei, did you found anything?

>"Junpei" LEFT
	Unfortunately not.

>"Seven" RIGHT "disappointed" CENTER
	Well, I guess it just was a complete waste of time.

	Indeed, it was a waste of time..

	Indeed.

		Junpei hoped that he didn't hear Seven and him talking in the living room.

>"Seven" RIGHT "idle" CENTER
	Well then don't waste time anymore, let's go.

	Let's go then.

	Intrigued by this safe, the three of them ran outside of the room, leading them further and further into the ship.
	#IF knows_about_ninth_bracelet
		Junpei asked himself if it was a good idea to not to tell Snake about the ninth bracelet.
		He decided he'll think about it when Seven won't be around them.
